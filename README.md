# Zelda3
A reimplementation of Zelda 3, hosted py SnesRev, ported to WASM by Madsuleiman

## About

This is a reverse engineered clone of Zelda 3 - A Link to the Past.

It's around 70-80kLOC of C code, and reimplements all parts of the original game. The game is playable from start to end.

You need a copy of the ROM to extract game resources (levels, images). Then once that's done, the ROM is no longer needed.

It uses the PPU and DSP implementation from [LakeSnes](https://github.com/elzo-d/LakeSnes), but with lots of speed optimizations.

Option 1: Building it yourself

## Installing Python & libraries on Windows (required for asset extraction steps)
1. Download [Python](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.1/python-3.11.1-amd64.exe) installer and install with "Add to PATH" checkbox checked
2. Open the command prompt
3. Type `python -m pip install --upgrade pip pillow pyyaml` and hit enter
4. Close the command prompt

## Installing libraries on Linux/MacOS
1. Open a terminal
2. Install pip if not already installed
```sh
python3 -m ensurepip
```
3. Clone the repo and `cd` into it
```sh
git clone https://github.com/snesrev/zelda3
cd zelda3
```
4. Install requirements using pip
```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Install SDL2
* Ubuntu/Debian `sudo apt install libsdl2-dev`
* Fedora Linux `sudo dnf install SDL2-devel`
* Arch Linux `sudo pacman -S sdl2`
* macOS: `brew install sdl2` (you can get homebrew [here](https://brew.sh/))

## Compiling on Linux/MacOS
1. Place your US ROM file named `zelda3.sfc` in `zelda3`
2. Compile
```sh
make
```

```sh
make -j$(nproc) # run on all core
make clean all  # clear gen+obj and rebuild
CC=clang make   # specify compiler
```
</details>

## More Compilation Help

Look at the wiki at https://github.com/snesrev/zelda3/wiki for more help.

The ROM needs to be named `zelda3.sfc` and has to be from the US region with this exact SHA256 hash
`66871d66be19ad2c34c927d6b14cd8eb6fc3181965b6e517cb361f7316009cfb`


## Usage and controls

The game supports snapshots. The joypad input history is also saved in the snapshot. It's thus possible to replay a playthrough in turbo mode to verify that the game behaves correctly.

The game is run with `./zelda3` and takes an optional path to the ROM-file, which will verify for each frame that the C code matches the original behavior.
